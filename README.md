# Secure Land Registration Management via Ethereum Blockchain

## 🔐 Project Overview

This project presents a **blockchain-based land registration system** built on the **Ethereum** platform. It aims to modernize land ownership management by reducing fraud, removing intermediaries, and offering a secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof alternative to conventional land records.

Using **smart contracts**, cryptographic security, and decentralized ledger technologies, this solution streamlines the land registration process, automates ownership transfer, and enhances transparency in real estate transactions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Eliminate document forgery and registration fraud
- 🔄 Automate land ownership transfers using smart contracts
- 📜 Provide a transparent, immutable digital record of ownership
- 🌱 Reduce paperwork and environmental impact
- 💰 Lower costs by removing middlemen and bureaucracy

## 🧩 System Modules

1. **User Registration**  
   - New users register and receive login credentials.
2. **Central Authority Module**  
   - Verifies users and land details before approving listings.
3. **Seller Portal**  
   - Add and register land for sale.
4. **Buyer Portal**  
   - View, request, and purchase land using blockchain integration.
5. **Smart Contracts**  
   - Facilitate secure land ownership transfers upon transaction validation.
6. **Blockchain Storage**  
   - All transactions are logged immutably and transparently on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🔐 Security Features

- Immutability through Ethereum's blockchain
- Role-based access (user, seller, admin)
- Smart contract automation to reduce manual error
- Cryptographic hashing and digital signature verification
- Fraud-resistant with audit trails and public verifiability

## 🧪 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js & npm
- Ganache (local Ethereum blockchain)
- MetaMask Extension (Chrome)
- Visual Studio Code / Remix IDE

📊 Architecture Overview
Ethereum blockchain used as a tamper-proof backend.

MetaMask for transaction signing and authentication.

Ganache for local development blockchain.

Flask server acts as a middleware between smart contracts and frontend UI.

Smart contracts define and enforce the rules for land ownership transfer.
